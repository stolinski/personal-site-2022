I get asked all the time about my favorite kung fu films. As an enthusiest, I tend to stay more in the Shaw Brothers studio side of things rather than Golden Harvest and modern production companies, so this list will be split into my favorites in Shaw and outside of Shaw studios.

## Favorite Shaw Brothers Films

- 5 Deadly Venoms
- 5 Fingers of Death
- The Secret Service of the Imperial Court
- Human Lanterns
- 36th Chamber of Shaolin
- Kid with the Golden Arms
- New One-Armed Swordsman
- Boxer From Shantung
- The Devil's Mirror
- Legend of the Bat

## Favorite Non-Shaw films

- The Blade
- Drunken Master (honestly any Jackie Chan film)
